    <h1>IDUKKI</h1>
    <p>Idukki district is a densely forested, mountainous region in the south Indian state of Kerala. In the north, Anamudi mountain towers over Eravikulam National Park, where the rare, blue Neelakurinji flower blooms every 12 years. Nearby, Munnar is a hill station known for its sprawling tea plantations and Tea Museum. Farther south is the vast, curved Idukki Dam and Periyar National Park, a tiger and elephant reserve.

             <h3>PERIYAR NATIONAL PARK</h3>   
             <P>Famous for its Tiger reserves and thick vegetation, the Periyar National Park is a perfect place for nature buffs and wildlife lovers. However, the best way to explore this natural habitat is by safaris either on jeep or elephants.

             <h3>MEESAPULIMALA</h3>   
             <P>The second highest peak in South India, Meesapulimala is an ideal spot for trekking. The starting point of the trek is either Rhodovalley or Silent Valley which lies 6 km before Rhodovalley. After trekking for about 8 km from Rhodovalley, one gets to witness the grasslands, wildlife, rainforests, and small waterfalls.
