             <h3>MUSEUM OF MATTANCHERRY</h3>   
             <P>
                A stroll through the lanes of Fort Kochi will definitely attract you to the rustic and old-fashioned neighbourhood of Mattancherry. It is said that back in the days, this cheri (street), was lined with mutton butchers, and so it ended up being called “Muttoncherry” which over the years evolved into “Mattancherry”.
